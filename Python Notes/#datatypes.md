### **Key Takeaways → What are the core concepts?**

Python has multiple data types, each serving a different purpose. Below are some of the most common ones:

- **Integers:** Whole numbers. Example: `my_number = 3` (Here, `3` is an integer.)
- **Strings:** A sequence of characters enclosed in quotes. Example: `my_text = "thirteen"` (Strings can use either single or double quotes.)
- **Floats:** Numbers with decimal points. Example: `my_decimal = 100.2`.
- **Lists:** Ordered, mutable collections that can hold multiple data types. Example: `my_list = [2, 3, 'listen']`.
- **Booleans:** Represent `True` or `False`, often used in conditional logic. Example: `print(3 > 1) # Output: True`.
- **Tuples:** Similar to lists but immutable (cannot be changed). Example: `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)`.
- **Dictionaries:** Key-value pairs stored in curly brackets. Example: `my_dict = {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}`.

### **How to Apply This? → Code challenges, real-world examples.**

- Data types are essential in real-world applications such as inventory tracking in a grocery store.
- **Example:** Dictionaries can store item names with corresponding prices, and Booleans can determine discount eligibility.

### **What’s Still Confusing? → Gaps in understanding that need deeper research.**

- Need clarification on the term for decimal point data type (it's called `float`).

### **Section #3 - Sub Section #2 - Numbers and Calculator**

### **Key Takeaways → What are the core concepts?**

- Python can be used as a calculator with standard arithmetic operations:
    - Addition: `+`
    - Subtraction:
    - Multiplication:
    - Division: `/`

### **How to Apply This? → Code challenges, real-world examples.**

- Example: A cleaning business can track the total number of services completed and use Python to forecast future bookings.

### **What’s Still Confusing? → Gaps in understanding that need deeper research.**

- No confusion, no flashcards needed.

### **Section #3 - Sub Section #3 - Variable Assignment**

### **Key Takeaways → What are the core concepts?**

- **Variable assignment** stores values for later use. Example: `my_number = 'two'`.
- Python is **dynamically typed**, meaning variables can change types.
- Unlike Python, **C++ is statically typed**, meaning variable types must be declared explicitly.

### **How to Apply This? → Code challenges, real-world examples.**

- Grocery stores can assign variables to store product prices and update them weekly.

### **What’s Still Confusing? → Gaps in understanding that need deeper research.**

- No confusion, no flashcards needed.

### **Section #3 - Sub Section #4 - Strings, Indexing, and Slicing**

### **Key Takeaways → What are the core concepts?**

- **Strings** can use either single or double quotes.
- `print()` displays output, similar to `console.log()` in JavaScript.
- **Indexing** starts at 0. Example: `H = 0, e = 1, l = 2` in `"Hello"`.
- **Slicing** extracts parts of a string using `[:]`. Example: `my_text[2:4]` returns characters from index 2 to 3.
- **Step size** skips characters: `my_text[::2]` returns every second character.
- **String concatenation** combines strings. Example: `greeting = "Hello" + " World"` → `Hello World`.
- **String methods:**
    - `.upper()`: Converts to uppercase.
    - `.lower()`: Converts to lowercase.
    - `.split()`: Splits a string into a list.

### **How to Apply This? → Code challenges, real-world examples.**

- No direct examples noted.

### **What’s Still Confusing? → Gaps in understanding that need deeper research.**

- Need to review certain string indexing concepts.

### **Section #3 - Sub Section #5 - Lists**

### **Key Takeaways → What are the core concepts?**

- Lists store multiple elements in square brackets: `my_list = ['dog', 'cat', 'rabbit']`.
- Lists allow indexing: `print(my_list[2]) # Output: rabbit`.

### **How to Apply This? → Code challenges, real-world examples.**

- Lists are commonly used in APIs and databases to store and retrieve data.

### **What’s Still Confusing? → Gaps in understanding that need deeper research.**

- No confusion, fully understood.

### **Section #3 - Sub Section #6 - Dictionaries**

### **Key Takeaways → What are the core concepts?**

- Dictionaries store **key-value pairs**. Example: `my_dict = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}`.
- Access values using keys: `my_dict['key1'] # Output: value1`.

### **How to Apply This? → Code challenges, real-world examples.**

- Grocery stores use dictionaries to store product prices associated with item names.

### **What’s Still Confusing? → Gaps in understanding that need deeper research.**

- No confusion, concept is clear.

### **Section #3 - Sub Section #7 - Tuples**

### **Key Takeaways → What are the core concepts?**

- Tuples are **immutable lists** (cannot be modified after creation). Example: `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)`.

### **How to Apply This? → Code challenges, real-world examples.**

- Tuples are used in scenarios where data integrity is critical and should not be altered.

### **What’s Still Confusing? → Gaps in understanding that need deeper research.**

- Will create flashcards for further review.

### **Section #3 - Sub Section #8 - Sets & Booleans in Python**

### **Key Takeaways → What are the core concepts?**

- **Booleans** represent `True` or `False` values.
- **Comparative operators:**
    - `<`, `>`, `==`, `!=` compare values.
- **Sets** are unordered collections of unique elements.

### **How to Apply This? → Code challenges, real-world examples.**

- Booleans can determine if a grocery store customer qualifies for a discount.

### **What’s Still Confusing? → Gaps in understanding that need deeper research.**

- Fully understood, no confusion.

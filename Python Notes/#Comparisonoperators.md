### **Key Takeaways → What are the core concepts?**

- Comparison operators allow you to compare two or more values.
- Types of comparison operators:
    - `<` (Less than)
    - `>` (Greater than)
    - `==` (Equal to)
    - `!=` (Not equal to)
    - `<=` (Less than or equal to)
    - `>=` (Greater than or equal to)
- These operators work with **integers, floats, and strings**. When used, they return a **boolean value** (`True` or `False`).
- **Examples:**
    - `2 == 2` → `True`
    - `10 < 5` → `False`
    - `"Hi" == "hi"` → `False` (Capitalization matters!)

### **How to Apply This? → Code challenges, real-world examples.**

- A **sales manager** could use comparison operators to track whether sales reps met their monthly quotas.
- Example: If a sales rep's closed deals are compared against their quota, the result will be `True` or `False`.

### **What’s Still Confusing? → Gaps in understanding that need deeper research.**

- No confusion, fully understood.

### **Section #4 - Sub Section #2 - Chaining Comparison Operators with Logical Operators**

### **Key Takeaways → What are the core concepts?**

- **Logical Operators** allow multiple comparisons to be chained together.
- The three main logical operators are:
    - `and` → Both conditions must be `True`.
    - `or` → At least one condition must be `True`.
    - `not` → Returns the opposite of the condition.
- **Examples:**
    - `2 == 2 and 3 > 1` → `True` (Both conditions are True)
    - `2 > 5 or 4 > 2` → `True` (One condition is True)
    - `not (2 > 4)` → `True` (Since `2 > 4` is `False`, `not` reverses it to `True`)

### **How to Apply This? → Code challenges, real-world examples.**

- Similar to the **sales manager example**, but with multiple criteria. For example:
    - **Sales reps must meet both a revenue target and a cold call quota.**
    - The comparison could use `and` to ensure both conditions are met before returning `True`.

### **What’s Still Confusing? → Gaps in understanding that need deeper research.**

- Need to reinforce the use of `not`, `and`, and `or` operators with flashcards.
- Added flashcards to practice logical operator functionality.

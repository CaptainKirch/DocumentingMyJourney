Hi!

This is my "Document The Journey" or "Building In Public" space where I am sharing everything that I am doing every single week while I work towards the goal of becoming a top 1% "AI Quant Developer".

This is a bold goal. I know....

I am starting from no prior knowledge in programming or computer science as well as middle school grade level in math. But that will not stop me from attempting this journey.

Now usually after I share that first introduction, people have many questions, so lets start with the breaking down each individual question you may have in your brain when reading that intro --

1. "Why do you want to do this? What for?"

- I spent my early and mid twenties focused on marketing and sales and entreprenurship. I have run 2 semi successful companies, although they both have been shut down, I learnt more than I could imagine about operations, hiring, managing talent, growing companies, sales and advertising, etc. The weird part is I am pretty good at those things, especially sales and marketing, from what I like to believe atleast....but an interesting thought I have been pursuing over the past year is... " Am I actually good at those things, or am I just above average thinking I talented?" Some people spend their entire lives purusing things they are above average at because they don't want to try anything else. 
- My main mission with doing this is I want to TRY something else, a new subject, a new industry, a new route, and hell maybe I am actually really talented at it and it was my long lost skill or I suck and I go back on course of what I was doing before all this and walk away with some skills. I see this as a win win situation.
- My final "reason" that I have for doing this is where I see the world going come 10-20 years. Now this is just a guess, but I really like "Cal Newports" thinking of this in his book "Deep Work" where he talks about in the future there will only be 3 types of people ( I am gonna butcher this description but bare with me, and look it up if you can he write it well). "People who work for the machines, people who work with the machines, and people who invest and own the machines." I want to work with the machines and invest and own the machines.... thats what I would enjoy.

2. "Whats Your Background In Coding and Math?" 
- Now this answer will cause most people to go "You are crazy, and this is a bold goal." The truth is, I have zero prior knowledge of computer science, programming, coding etc. I am however computer literate and know my way around tech to a certain degree, I am not an idiot with tech lol.
- Math on the other hand... I have failed math classes my entire life, and ending highschool with a 70% grade level in math and then doing ZERO math classes in college until now. The tough part is in order to be really good at Quantative Finance and AI Development and overall programming, math skill is KEY and a massive skill gap between an average programming and a good one comes from problem solving and math skills from what I have learnt. So I am gonna need to start from the very ground level, yes I mean Pre Algebra level.



3. "Isn't it gonna be hard? or near impossible to learn all that?"

- This is gonna be hard and a long road, but I don't care.... I want to do this. A massive personal discovery I have made is I use to believe I was old (I am 29 years old), I basically had a quarter life crisis of evaluation into myself, asking why am I not farther ahead... this is an idiotic thought to have at my age I have learnt and for anyone for that matter. So in resetting my mindset I am not focused on long term 20-30 years down the road, what do I want to be doing, so seeing this massively long pathway of knowledge and skills needing to develope, I dont see it as impossible, I am confident over a long enough time line anything is possible to learn. Its just a matter of how much you want it to stick with it.



4. "What Is your learnig pathway? What courses and education are you taking?"

- I am gonna share with you my entire first year learning pathway, ignore the timelines on it, those are simply goals. Also I want to give a disclaimer, this is ALL I am doing, I am not working a job, I have 2-3 freelance clients paying my bills and I am spending ALL day and waking hours 6-7 days a week doing this (minding my mental bandwidth and not causing burn out ofcourse), so this syllabus will seem bold but truthfully I am already almost 30 days into this and I am able to solve 6KYU CodeWars problems somewhat consistently as well as can write basic programming scripts with Python mini projects. In addition, I have taken "Cal Newports - Deep Work" book to exterme heart and have delete all social media and when I am doing deep work thats all I do, I sit and focus 100% energy for averaging around 4-5 hours per day. But I will get into my study habits in the future and share them with you down the line maybe.

Hi!

This is my "Document The Journey" or "Building In Public" space where I am sharing everything that I am doing every single week while I work towards the goal of becoming a top 1% "AI Quant Developer".

This is a bold goal. I know....

I am starting from no prior knowledge in programming or computer science as well as middle school grade level in math. But that will not stop me from attempting this journey.

Now usually after I share that first introduction, people have many questions, so lets start with the breaking down each individual question you may have in your brain when reading that intro --

1. "Why do you want to do this? What for?"
- Its hard to say one specific reason but I think the main motivate to be brutally transparent is I enjoy working towards HARD things, and I enjoy learning and gaining knowledge. As well 



2. "Whats Your Background In Coding and Math? " 



3. "Isn't it gonna be hard? or near impossible to learn all that?"



4. "What Is your learnig pathway? What courses and education are you taking?"



5. "Is anyone helping you? Or do you have a tutor or teacher right now?"

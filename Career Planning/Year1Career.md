## ðŸ§© Phase 1A (Marâ€“Jun 2025): Laying the Foundation

### ðŸ”¹ Strategic Objective:

- Build core problem-solving skills in Python
- Lock in Pre-Algebra and transition to Algebra 1
- Establish systems (Anki, GitHub, Deep Work tracking)

### ðŸ”¹ Execution Breakdown:

### âœ… Algorithm Patterns (Python Only)

- **Order:** Sliding Window â†’ Two Pointers â†’ Hash Maps â†’ Sorting â†’ Stacks & Queues â†’ Greedy â†’ Prefix Sum â†’ Backtracking (if time)
- **How:**
    - 5 CodeWars (6â€“4 kyu) per pattern
    - 5 LeetCode Easy/Medium per pattern
    - Read Grokking only *after* solving problems
- **Leads into:** Efficient problem-solving â†’ LeetCode Mediums â†’ C++ syntax application

### âœ… Python Deep Work

- Refactor problems, practice syntax fluency
- Use Anki for syntax, pattern logic, and edge cases
- **Leads into:** C++ translation, Python backtesting logic, ML feature engineering

### âœ… Math: Pre-Algebra â†’ Algebra 1

- Finish Pre-Algebra (Krista King)
- Begin Algebra 1 by April
- Daily review + weekly topic consolidation
- **Leads into:** Probability, Pre-Calc, and ML model logic (linear equations, optimization)

### âœ… Intro to NumPy & Pandas (Mini Data Prep)

- Introduce NumPy arrays, basic indexing, broadcasting
- Learn Pandas DataFrames, filtering, aggregation
- Use YouTube + Kaggle for beginner tutorials
- Goal: be ready for simple data analysis by June
- **Leads into:** Backtester development, ML datasets, time-series

### âœ… Support Systems

- Set up GitHub repo + daily commits
- Track weekly Deep Work hours (whiteboard/system)
- Create and review Anki cards daily
- **Leads into:** Consistency, trackable progress, long-term portfolio

## âœ… **What Year 1 Actually Builds (Strategically)**

| Skill | Why It Matters |
| --- | --- |
| **Algorithms + Patterns** | Youâ€™ll solve 95% of the logic in trading systems, signal models, or optimizers. Itâ€™s the core. |
| **Python Proficiency** | Still the #1 language for AI, ML, and research. Youâ€™ll use it in every quant and research pipeline. |
| **C++ Fluency** | Required for latency, execution algos, and real HFT systems. Firms **need** devs who understand performance at a low level. |
| **Competitive Programming (CP)** | Makes you fast under pressure, strong at edge cases, and confident in interviews. Most quants are weak here â€” you wonâ€™t be. |
| **Math Foundations (Algebra â†’ Calc 2)** | Unlocks everything from regression models to gradient descent to derivatives in quant finance. Youâ€™ll understand what the model is *doing*, not just the API call. |
| **Backtesting + NumPy/Pandas** | First real quant toolkit. Gets you ready for real-world modeling, research, and AI deployment in trading. |
| **Scikit-Learn + ML Basics** | Preps you for signal models, alpha generation, and strategy classification. The perfect level for Year 1. |
| **Time-Series + Quant Strategies** | First step into real alpha â€” understanding *patterns over time*, not just static predictions. |
| **Execution Systems / GitHub / Paper Trading** | Gives you actual artifacts â€” projects, codebases, research â€” that lead to jobs, internships, or SaaS startups. |

The Idea Of Failure

I write this blog as a self reminder and to share a concept I have been thinking about recently.

I wanna share some context before I share.  Below I have listed some failures I have had, but these failures are ones where I failed but continued trying until I was successful.

Failed At Achieving The Right SAT Score To Get Into College 5 Times. Passed On The 6th.
Failed My Real Estate Licensing Exam 4 Times. Passed On The 5th.
Failed Business Law Class In College 2 Times. Passed On The 3rd.
Failed To Get Lacrosse Conference Championship 3 Times. Team Won On The 4th Year.
And these are just a few moments over the past 29 years of my life, now not all of these are related to business or entrepreneurship but it has for sure made me think a lot about my career path and growing as a business operator and entrepreneur. 

The two main ones that I reflect on are me growing a cleaning business and then failing by my definition and also me growing a online coaching business and failing in that, both of which I spent almost 7 years on growing and building. It was rough each time of failure, I went basically dead broke and had no money, and each time I pulled myself together and got out of the ditch and prepared for another attempt at success.

I am thinking of this right now because I feel like I am going into another moment like that, another moment of taking a swing at bat, this time more nervous and maybe my risk tolerance has taken a slight hit, but I need to remind myself to not let off the gas, and that as long as I don't stop and as long as I keep trying at some point I will by my definition "make it" and be "successful."

The interesting part about failing and continuing to try is you really have no idea what attempt you take you will make it. 

You just gotta keep your head up and keep rolling.

I write this for all of the successful failures out there.

Hope you enjoyed.

bye.

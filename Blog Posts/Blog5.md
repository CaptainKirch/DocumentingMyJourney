2 Month Into Journey Personal Lessons
Its been a little while since I have written a blog post, I need to write updates more often.

I have been into my "Learning to Code" or "Quant AI" journey for over 2 months now, and wow it has been amazing.

I have learnt a lot about my self and have learnt a ton about the industry and entire software industry. Lets share....

Also P.S - I am gonna make another blog in the next week or so actually sharing how far along I am with my journey and what I have completed with my curriculum but this is me just sharing some initial personal learnings.

I am gonna list them ALL below and then break down each in a separate paragraph underneath.

Growing up its not that I was bad at school or had learning problems.... its that I never was taught how to learn correctly.
Going cold turkey on quitting social media and focusing my daily calendar only on deep work was something I wish I did 10 years ago.
Id rather feel broke with no cashflow and building skills than have cashflow and have no time to develop skills.
Lets start with the first one - growing up I always was told or believed that I was bad at school, I believed that I had a learning disability or that I just didn't work hard enough or study enough to get better grades. And truthfully to put to put it blunt I always just felt dumb as a kid. 

Well I have made a very interesting discovery about myself, I have been self teaching and self studying coding and mathematics for almost 2 months now and have come to the exciting but truthfully very sad realization that it wasn't that I was "dumb" or sucked at school....it was that I just never was taught how to learn properly... and not knowing how to study or learn properly puts you behind the eight ball from the very beginning. This is the first time in my life I have figured out "how to" learn correctly and "how to" study correctly and I will tell you what, it makes me feel like I can learn anything.... 

Here are some tricks I have done that have worked for me:

Anki Flash Cards: its a phenomenal software download it and use it. I do about 1 hour of flash cards every day morning 30 mins and evening 30 mins, I do these flash cards on coding syntax or math concepts. 
Watch Lectures Then Take Notes: What I have done as I am self teaching is I have courses and lectures I am going through, free online Harvard Classes, MIT, and Udemy courses. I always watch the section I am learning, I DON'T take notes while I am watching and then only after I have watched I then take notes on what I can remember, and only then if I forget I go back rewatch and fill in the gaps.
Speak Out loud: This is a massive winner for helping me learn, I don't move on from a subject unless I can easily explain it out loud to myself through a voice memo. I have done this daily with new topics and it has worked super well.
Just focus, no distractions: I put my phone in another room, I only have a stop watch to track the time, and my computer with only the exact work I'm doing open on my computer. I don't check my emails, no SMS, and all notifications are on DND, this is an easy hack.
Alright here is the second personal learning, and its SOOO basic and most people are gonna roll their eyes when they read this but its one of the best decisions I have made in my life... at least it feels that way so far.

Quit Social Media For Good.

I tend to be a very extreme person, its a double edge sword.... but thats another conversation. In saying that, I decided 2 months ago to delete all social media apps, block websites, block news sources, and completely unplug. Like I mean, to the point of ask me something about current events and I have no clue... lol

Now this is not for most, but I will tell you the hack, in doing this I noticed the effects immediately, like within 24 hours and then even more so within 48 hours. And the biggest thing I noticed was that I bored myself into productivity.... I was getting so bored and I had so much more free time not scroll, watching youtube, or watching tv... that I had no idea what to do with myself so I basically said.... fine guess ill get work done... cause there is nothing else to do...lol..

Highly recommend....anyways this is lame... everyone tells everyone to quit social media...basic advice, I know but I wanted to share.

And last personal learning of myself is, I would rather feel cashflow poor and building skills than no skills and cashflow rich... I am not one to brag or speak on money, but I have done very well for myself for a failed entrepreneur in his late 20's I have had some amazing months and years of income... and cashflow was amazing... but what I have realized is with gaining skills, even just beginner ones over the past 2 months is that I love learning and getting better more than I love cashflow and money. 

Life is way better when you are working towards mastering a skill or craft and its much more fun. Money can be made, you have your entire life to make money (speaking to myself here). 

The free time that you get to focus on skill building is worth the short term sacrifice of no cashflow or little cashflow. 

Anyways thats it for my blog. I am tired of typing now anyways.

Bye.

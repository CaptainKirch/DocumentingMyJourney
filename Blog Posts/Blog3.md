how to know when to pivot.

I had a conversation with an old friend of mine today and we talked about almost 2 hours about life and business and just overall psychology of being an entrepreneur. 

He is what I would call a successful business owner in the online coaching and info marketing space. He has done well for himself but what I found interesting is that him and I both crashed and burned our first coaching companies, and he got right back into it and rescaled a coaching company and I decided to not to and instead took a job with mid level to low level pay and now take the route of learning software as my main focus.

Now he shared with me on the call that he had a thought a lot about and self reflected a lot around the concept of "I quit too soon and I wish I just kept going when things got hard." He said this because in the beginning of the conversation he shared how his business was hard right now and he sometimes was enjoying it and sometimes not. 

And I also had a sneaky suspicion he was sharing this with me because he thought I feel into the camp of this. He felt like maybe I have been pivoting or changing routes when I should just do the thing and stay the course.

Now I know 100% he was coming from a place of care and assistance and trying to give advice to me and I appreciate that a ton, and truthfully he could be right, only the future knows the truth.

But what really has me thinking for the past 3 hours after our conversation is the concept of "how to know when to pivot". Now this is a large subject and I am attempting not to be bias right now, and truthfully why shouldn't I believe him, maybe I am the idiot here, the truth is: he makes more money than me, he has a business, I work for the man, he is back in a fancy apartment, I live with my parents still, and he does not worry about money at all where I do every single month paying off debt.

But a part of me and my gut has its guard up big time. A part of me also sits here and wonders "am I making a big mistake? Am I wasting time right with pivoting" or "should I just launch another service business or coaching business again, I can make some good cashflow with it."

Its hard to know what is right and what is wrong.

And I am not a believer that the grass will be greener on the other side, with me pivoting going to software. 

I reflect a lot on this quote from Naval Ravikant - https://youtu.be/Ko0MWv5TZ5s?si=AY6hsQVj7B-FkWfO

And that is all.

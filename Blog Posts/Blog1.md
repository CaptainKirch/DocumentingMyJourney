Deep Work.

Cal Newport the author of the book "Deep Work" changed my entire outlook on what it means to be productive in life.

Over the past 2-3 weeks I have done the following items:

Deleted 100% social media applications off my phone - Facebook, Youtube, Twitter/X, Instagram, TikTok, and the list goes on.
Have maintained and still have not watched any or consumed any social media content.
Have completely stopped consuming news content and current events type content.
Spent any free time added to reading books I enjoy, business books, statistics books, mindset books, etc.
Spent any free time added to doing programming lessons and working on my programming projects.
Become comfortable being bored.
Become comfortable saying "no" 100% of the time to things I don't wanna do.
And thats just the start of the list...I have taken what feels like a 360 degree shift in how I am operating day to day.

I like to think of it as being confident in managing my "dopamine" and my "attention span."

In these past 2-3 weeks I have done over 30 hours of deep focus work on learning to program and reading books and I have read over 5 books, I have learnt fundamentals of Javascript and I am almost 50% confident in development for front end software.

I am now getting dopamine from completing things and completing work in my day to day. This has changed my entire outlook on how to become successful and what it takes.

In addition, another thing I have realized when I was consuming social media or just scrolling the internet, is when an event happened when I got stuck, say it was an email with a client who had a problem, or anything that took me more than 5 mins of energy to plan and think about on solving. I would avoid the problem and pick my phone up and begin consuming social media content or scrolling through the internet to distract myself.

The world has become a a place where we live in a time where if you can harness you dopamine addiction you are basically a superhero.

I will update you on how things are going in the next 5-6 months of me sticking to this regiment.

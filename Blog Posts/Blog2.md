I Got Fired.....

I got fired from my job.

The past 24 hours have been very very interesting for me. The following has happened:

I got fired from my job by my boss via a direct slack message.
I have had to off board over 50 clients that were not happy with the change of moving to a new account manager(that was my job title).
I finally figured out 100% what I want to do with my life for the next 10 years. This is something I think I have realized for a while but I finally have a push to actually doing it.
Its been a weird 24 hours to say the least. A part of me is insanely angry, and I mean foam at the mouth level angry, because a company I worked for, for over 8 months let me go via a slack message. And another part of me is grateful and thankful that I have been given a push in a new direction.

The second I got the news within a few hours I already knew what I wanted to do next, I have a hunch that I already knew what that was but the job held me back from taking the leap with aggressive action.

I am going to sleep on the idea and what I see my pathway being for the next few days and make sure I am not making any bad judgements or selecting the wrong vehicle but I have a gut feeling I am set on this route.

Having a job is a funny thing, it allows you to take risks and I always thought it was a good thing to have as it made your income secure which enabled you to take more risks, but I am starting to think, not having a job is better if you know what you are doing and your time management is organized.

Its a weird dichotomy of things.

Anyways, I may end up writing more blogs as time progresses here. Bye.

I just turned 34 years old, and I just completed a CodeForces contest, I placed 1st, and I finally
hit the rating of 2,500. I am now officially in the top 10% of the entire world at competitive
programming. In addition, my Leetcode score is ranked in the top 100 in the entire world.

Every morning I wake up with new emails in my inbox with new job offers from some of the top
tech companies and finance companies in the world with job offers and interview requests.


I am seeing offers between $500k - $750k every single month, these companies in Asia, US,
and Canada are begging me to work for them.
I have mastered:
- Competitive Programming
- LeetCode
- Python and C++
- Artificial Intelligence
- Machine Learning
- Advanced Mathematics


I am able to build anything I want in the entire tech software space, A.I space, as well as in the
Quant finance space.
I got here through daily execution:
- I reinvented myself at the age of 30, it sucked but it was so worth it.
- In my late 20â€™s, I lived at my parents house, saving every dime.
- I only focused on programming and mathematics and trying to become the best.
- I even became a janitor in the evenings to support my learning and coding time during
the days.
- I focused on nothing but skills 7 days a week.
